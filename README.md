# Final-project

Project Report Requirements:
Title and Abstract:
Include a clear and concise project title.
Write an abstract (150-250 words) summarizing the purpose, methodology, results, and conclusions of your project.
Introduction:
Provide background information on the problem you are addressing.
Clearly state the objective of the project and its significance in the context of machine learning.
Methodology:
Describe the dataset used (e.g., how it was collected or sourced, key features, and any preprocessing steps).
Explain the machine learning models applied (both supervised and unsupervised methods, if relevant), with justification for your model selection.
Include any data exploration and visualization methods used.
Mention any model optimization techniques employed (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, etc.).
Results:

If applicable, include evaluation metrics for clustering, such as Silhouette Score.
Provide visualizations of your results (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.) where appropriate.
Discussion:
Interpret the results and explain their significance.
Discuss any challenges encountered during the project and how they were overcome.
Highlight any ethical considerations or real-world implications of your findings.
Conclusion:
Summarize the key findings and their potential applications.
Suggest areas for future research or improvements to the model.
